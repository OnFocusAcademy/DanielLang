# Daniel Programming Language Documentation

Daniel is an object oriented programming language with all the features of a first-class functional language. That means that, unlike in languages like C, functions are values that can be passed as parameters and returned from functions just like any other value. The interpreter is written in JavaScript and its syntax evaluates to JavaScript values.
