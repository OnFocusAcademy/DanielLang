# Daniel Programming Language

A Lisp-like language with macros for learning about programming languages and interpreters.

This implementation is a simple tree-walking interpreter. It uses linked lists as its abstract syntax tree (AST) for homoiconicity between source code and the underlying data structure read by the interpreter.
